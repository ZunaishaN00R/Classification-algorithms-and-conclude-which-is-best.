 Load digits dataset from scikit-learn. Apply Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithms. Train models on the data, create a confusion matrix for digit recognition evaluation. Optimize performance using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV).
Digit Recognition Comparison
# Digit Recognition Comparison

# Overview:
# Data Source:
Utilized the digits dataset from scikit-learn.
# Algorithms:
Implemented Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers.
# Training:
Trained models on the provided training data.
# Evaluation:
Utilized confusion matrices to visualize the performance in recognizing each digit.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted experiments with different hyperparameters, resulting in KNN achieving an accuracy of 0.99 and Random Forest with an accuracy of 0.97.

# Results:
Random Forest Accuracy: 0.97
KNN Accuracy: 0.99

# Conclusion:
KNN demonstrated superior accuracy (0.99) compared to Random Forest (0.97) in digit recognition. This suggests that, for this specific task, KNN may be a more suitable algorithm. Further optimization through hyperparameter tuning could enhance model performance.
